In this project, I want to show you the bulling and capturing event handling process from my heart.

First, Clicking on the spin and see the best wishes I make for you 

Second, Clicking on a heart, it will show you the event handling through the capturing process then bubbling process.

The event handling propogation (bubbling process is more useful) provides a concise method to add eventhandling to many elements at one time. Think you create a long list that handles a similiar event, click as an example. It will be teious work to add an event listener to every list item. Such codes are unreadable also. Bubbling propogation will save your hair on your head :)
